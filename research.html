												I work primarily at the intersection of theoretical and
													observational astrophysics, aiming to bridge models with
													data by interpreting observations within the framework
													of theoretical predictions.
												My research incorporates both analytical and numerical methods
													to tackle a variety of astrophysical topics.

												 </p>

												<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

												The main project of my Ph.D. focuses on understanding high-redshift quasars
													through <a href="#flamingo">large-volume cosmological simulations</a>.
												I am developing a theoretical framework to interpret observations
													of quasars and galaxies over cosmic time, addressing fundamental
													questions such as: <i>Where does
												quasar activity takes place? How do the properties of quasars relate
												to those of their host halos/galaxies? What is the timescale of quasar
													activity, and how does it influence the growth of
													supermassive black holes?</i> </p>

												<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
												In this context, I initially explored the implications of the
													<a href="#quasar_z4">
													demographic and clustering properties of quasars</a> before cosmic noon.
												My focus then shifted to JWST observations, which are rapidly  transforming
													our understanding of the early Universe.
													I developed a model to jointly constrain
													quasar and galaxy properties using <a href="#quasar_z6">JWST clustering
													measurements</a> and investigated the characteristics of the abundant
													population of broad-line AGN discovered by JWST,
													often referred to as <a href="#lrd">"little red dots"</a>.
<!--												Currently, I am focusing on the role played by quasar obscuration-->
<!--													across cosmic time, and I am working on extending quasar population models-->
<!--													to incorporate single quasar lightcurves.-->
<!--													I am also interested in hydrodynamical cosmological-->
<!--												simulations, and I am investigating how well simulations can-->
<!--												reproduce the properties of massive black holes and quasars-->
<!--												across cosmic time.-->
												</p>


												<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
												I am also deeply interested in the formation and evolution of galaxies.
													For instance,
													I have investigated models of
													<a href="#outflows">galactic outflows</a> in the context
														of observations of
													extended [CII] halos in high redshift galaxies.
												In addition, I have experience in parameter inference for
												<a href="#grav_waves">gravitational wave signals</a>
													and have utilized radiative transfer simulations
													to study the morphology of
													<a href="#discs">protoplanetary discs</a>.

													Quasar clustering measurements are a powerful probe of the physical

													In the first project of my Ph.D., we revisited this decade-long

													mode is particularly powerful for spectroscopically identifying high-redshift quasars
													and galaxies across vast comoving volumes. Using <b>NIRCam/WFSS observations</b>
													of bright <b>high-z quasar fields</b>, surveys such as EIGER and ASPIRE

													The dramatic leap in sensitivity brought by JWST has also led to wildly
													unexpected discoveries, such as the presence of an abundant population
													of <b>broad-line high-z AGN</b> candidates appearing
													as "little red dots" (LRDs) in JWST imaging.
													When correcting for obscuration effects, these LRDs have surprisingly
													<b>large bolometric luminosities</b>, comparable to the ones of the
													UV-selected quasars whose properties have been studied for decades.
													This is incredibly surprising, since UV-luminous quasars are selected
													from wide-field 1400 deg\(^2\) deep imaging surveys, whereas JWST AGN
													are identified in surveys of not more than ~300-600 arcmin\(^2\).
													Such a massive difference indicates that these AGN are <b>far more abundant</b>
													than comparably luminous UV-unobscured quasars, implying that our understanding
													of <b>SMBH growth</b> and
													quasar/AGN activity in the early Universe needs to be thoroughly revised.
													By comparing the properties of JWST AGN/LRDs to the ones of UV-selected quasars,
													we have concluded that <b>LRDs outnumber quasars</b> by a large factor that
													rapidly evolves with redshift. Interestingly, this suggests that
													the large population of LRDs cannot be accommodated in the same
													halos where unobscured quasars live. Hence, LRDs may
													represent a <b>different evolutionary phase</b> of early SMBHs. This
													hypothesis will be ultimately tested by constraining the clustering
													of LRDs, for which we have developed a successful <b>mock analysis</b> based on
													a quasar population model.

													<b>Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</b> follow the non-linear

													variety of processes that are important to the physics of galaxies,

													properties. As a consequence, they have started to play a key role
													in shaping our understanding of the <b>formation and evolution of
													galaxies in the Universe</b>, as well as the relation between galaxies
													and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are harbored at their
													center. While much effort has been devoted to the study of the
													connection between SMBHs and their hosting galaxies in terms of
													gas fueling and AGN feedback, only few studies have focused on
													the <b>global properties of SMBHs</b> and their evolution over cosmic
													time. Specifically, SMBHs are visible at cosmological distances
													when they turn into <b>bright quasars</b>. Quasars are, however, extremely
													rare objects, hence their statistical properties can only be studied
													theoretically when large simulated volumes are available.
													In a project that I am co-supervising, we use the cosmological simulations from

													Investigating the complex environments of galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization
													is one of the most pressing research goals of modern astrophysics.
													In this context, the advent of telescopes such as ALMA and NOEMA have opened a new
													window on the primordial Universe, allowing us to shed light on
													the obscured star formation and ISM line emission at rest-frame FIR
													wavelengths up to z~7.
<!--													Combining the-->

<!--													FIR emission lines such as [CII], [O III], and CO from various rotational-->
<!--													levels, we are rapidly improving our understanding of the small-scale,-->

													One of the most compelling findings made by ALMA is that a significant

													As part of my Master Thesis, I worked with Andrea Ferrara, Andrea Pallottini,
													and the cosmology group at SNS on finding a plausible
													mechanism to explain the formation of these halos. We focused on the
													hypothesis that these halos result from the remnants of past â€“
													or ongoing â€“ <b>outflow activity</b>. We explored this idea by using a semi-analytical model for
													an outflow that undergoes <b>catastrophic cooling</b> in the inner region of the halo. By computing
													the abundance of singly ionized Carbon and simulating the resulting [C II] emission, we
													compared our model with data from, e.g., the ALMA ALPINE program,
													and we conclude that outflows represent a <b>promising answer</b> to explain the origin of the
													observed [C II] halos.  Our model
													 points to the presence of extended [CII] emission at high redshifts
													as a tangible sign of <b>star-formation-driven feedback mechanisms</b>
													being already in place well into the Epoch of Reionization.

													Constraining the strength of <b>gas turbulence</b> in protoplanetary discs is crucial
													for understanding the physics of gas accretion and planet formation.
													A promising method to gauge the level of gas turbulence in discs is to measure the <b>vertical
													scale height</b> of the dust component - which is expected to be coupled to the gas component
													through gas-dust coupling. This has become possible in the last few years
													thanks to the very <b>high-resolution observations</b> provided by the ALMA telescope.
													These observations uncovered a large amount of features in the 2d images
													of protoplanetary discs, including <b>dark gaps and emission rings</b>.
													As shown by <i>Pinte et al. 2016</i>,
													it is possible to exploit these features to uncover the <b>3-d morphology of discs</b>.
													The idea is simple: due to <b>projection effects</b>, a gap in a disc emission
													profiles will be partly filled by the emission coming from the
													neighbouring regions. This effect is stronger along the minor axis
													of the disc, whereas the major axis is only marginally affected. Hence,
													 one can compare the <b>gap contrast</b> along the major and
													minor axes to infer the amount of "filling" that has taken place.
													The extent of this gap filling is directly dependent on the vertical structure of the
													disc.
<!--													Hence, a measurement of the gap contrast-->
<!--													along the major and minor axes can be used to infer the vertical scale-->
<!--													height of the disc, and to indirectly gauge the amount of gas turbulence in discs.-->

													In collaboration with Giovanni Rosotti and Benoit Tabone,
													we applied this method to high-resolution <b>DSHARP observations</b>.
													We built a radiative transfer model to reproduce the
													observed gap constrast for different values of the dust scale heights.
													and found that the scale heights that yield a better agreement with data are
													generally small, implying
													<b>low levels of gas turbulence in discs</b>. This represents an important
													step towards understanding the physical processes that govern the
													formation of planets in discs.
<!--													We also investigated the properties of the sources-->
<!--													for which our method yields no significant constraints on the disc-->
<!--													vertical structure, and concluded-->
<!--													that this is because these discs have either a low inclination or gaps-->
<!--													that are not deep enough. -->
<!--													Based on our analysis, we provided an empirical-->
<!--													criterion to assess whether a given disc is suitable to measure the-->
<!--													vertical scale height-->

												<div style="padding-bottom: 100px;font-size: 26px">

													With the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015,
													the era of <b>gravitational-wave astronomy</b> has begun. This first decade
													of observations has already provided a wealth of information about
													compact binary mergers of neutron stars and black holes. The future
													of this research field looks even brighter, with the <b>next generation of detectors</b>
													such as the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope expected to
													observe hundreds of thousands of binary coalescence events each year.
													With huge leaps in sensitivity, however, new challenges arise.
													One of the most pressing issues for the next generation of detectors
													is that signals from coalescing binaries will be so frequent that
													they will start to <b>overlap in the time domain</b>.
													When two signals overlap, the standard data-analysis pipelines
													used to detect and infer the properties of these signals
													are not guaranteed to work. In particular, multiple signals overlapping
													in the time/frequency domain may result in biases in the final parameter estimates.
<!--													overlapping signals,-->
<!--													While the detection-->
<!--													pipelines have been shown to work well even in the presence of-->
<!--													overlapping signals, the parameter inference algorithms used to-->
<!--													estimate the properties of these signals represent a more compelling-->
<!--													problem, as overlap of multiple signals in the time/frequency-->
<!--													domains may result in biases in the final parameter estimates.-->
													In a work done with Bangalore Sathyaprakash, Surabhi
													Sachdev, and Anuradha Gupta,
													we quantified the biases arising by using
													 current parameter inference pipelines to constrain the
													parameters of a signal
													in the presence of multiple overlapping ones. We showed that, by setting
													a prior
													on the coalescence time,
													it is possible to correctly infer the properties of
													multiple overlapping signals even
													with the current data-analysis infrastructure, provided that the
													coalescence times of the signals in the detector frame
													are more than ~1-2 seconds apart.
<!--													This implies that for the vast-->
<!--													majority of the signals that will be detected by future detectors,-->
<!--													our current framework for parameter inference will work just fine.-->
													Signals whose coalescence epochs lie
													within ~0.5 seconds of each other, however, suffer from significant
													biases, requiring future developments of new strategies and algorithms.
